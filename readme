This repository includes the main python codes for creating 9 tiles of high value fresh water ecosystems with 30 meter resolution. the codes are running for each tile separately and the main input to the code is the aligned UMD land cover (30 meter), Merit stream down sample to 30 meter and lign to UMD layer, catchment derived from merit stream and slope layer ( see the paper method) and down sample to 30 meter and align to UMD, GFplain90 meter  align to uMD layer. the maximun and minimum delieation codea are running for each of the 90 tiles covering the glob (see the guide figure) separately and the main inputs for each tile is the UMD, stream, catchment and GFplain for that tile. the output HVFE tile is in WGS84. 

the country HVEFs max is for creating the HVFEs for each country separately. it uses the united nation shapefile (attached) to crop the country and to calculate the area of each HVFE class in each country the code includes a details method for projection.

countrly class 8 is for extracting the riparian classess for each country and save the tiff file for each country

next python code is for finding the intersection of the UMD land cover data for each country and do the pixel wise comparison between the UMD and country based tif files ( from the pervious code) to find the distributoion of UMD layer for the 
HVFEs components per country.
