High-Value Freshwater Ecosystem (HVFE) Mapping â€“ Python Code Repository


This repository contains the primary Python scripts used to generate 9 HVFE tiles globally at 30-meter resolution. The workflow processes each tile independently, using several aligned geospatial inputs.

ðŸ”¹ Input Datasets
Each HVFE tile is generated using the following key inputs (aligned to the 30-meter UMD Land Cover layer):

UMD Land Cover (30m)

MERIT Hydro Stream (downsampled to 30m and aligned to UMD)

Catchments derived from MERIT streams

Slope (downsampled and aligned to UMD)

GFplain (Global Floodplain, 90m) resampled and aligned to UMD

See the associated paper for full methodological details.

ðŸ”¹ Code Functionality
maximum_delineation.py and minimum_delineation.py
These scripts perform maximum and minimum scenario delineations for each of the 90 global tiles (see guide figure). Inputs include:

UMD Land Cover

Stream Layer

Catchments

GFplain (floodplain extent)

The output is a tile-based HVFE map in WGS84 projection.

country_HVFE_max.py
This script generates HVFE maps at the country level, using:

A United Nations country shapefile (included)

National boundaries to clip HVFEs

Area calculations for each HVFE class per country (in hectares)

Proper reprojection steps to ensure spatial accuracy

country_UMD.py
This script computes the intersection between UMD land cover and HVFE classes per country:

Extracts UMD land cover statistics for each HVFE class

Calculates land cover areas (in hectares) by class

Requires the user to define the specific HVFE class of interest (e.g., floodplain from maximum scenario = class 6)

The included example extracts UMD land cover stats only for floodplain (class 6) under the maximum delineation scenario.
